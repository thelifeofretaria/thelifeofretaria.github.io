										<p>For this seminar we have prepared a <strong>workshop on phylogenetics and molecular clock calibration</strong>.<br>
										We would like to make more accessible molecular approaches, break myths, introduce basic concepts and showcase practical examples, hoping to bridge the micropaleontological and the Life of Retaria communities. We briefly showed where to find molecular data, how to run phylogenies, how to interpret phylogenies and how to calibrate the molecular clock, so that interested audience can begin to explore the fascinating world of DNA comparative approaches.<br>
										<br>
										<b>Raphael Morard</b>, <b>Mattia Greco</b> and <b>Miguel M. Sandin</b>, jhave shared their experience, with the help of micropaleontological experts <b>Adam Woodhouse</b> and <b>Johan Renaudi</b>.</p>
										Please, find in <a href="https://github.com/thelifeofretaria/workshop1_rocks-meet-clocks/tree/main" target="_blank">this github repository</a> the materials we used for the workshop.<br>
										And have a look at the recording in <a href="https://youtu.be/m3sUC9PXV_w" target="_blank">our channel</a>!<br>

												<b>Skeletal structure, phylogeny, taxonomy and symbiosis of Phaeodaria and Radiolaria</b><br>
												Phaeodaria and Radiolaria are groups of marine protists bearing siliceous skeletons. Molecular studies revealed that Phaeodaria are phylogenetically different from Radiolaria, however, the morphological diversity and intra-group phylogeny of Phaeodaria are still wrapped in mystery. Furthermore, the species diversity of Radiolaria has not sufficiently been clarified, and numerous new taxa have recently been reported. Given this situation, the difference in skeletal structure between Phaeodaria (porous) and Radiolaria (solid) will be presented showing data of Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) and Micro-Xray Computed Tomography (MXCT). The latest knowledge on the phylogeny, taxonomy and symbiosis of Phaeodaria and Radiolaria will also be explained in this presentation.

												<b>Foraminiferal contribution to benthic ecosystem functioning</b><br>
												In this talk I will present the results of some case studies discussing how foraminifera contribute to the benthic ecosystem functioning. Ecological observations in low-oxygen settings showed notable resistance to hypoxic conditions and high contribution to benthic nitrate reduction via denitrification. We also studied the diverse symbioses of foraminifera showing that harbour photosymbionts contributing to O2 production in coastal environment and bacterial symbionts that might be involved in various anaerobic pathways. Finally, work on foraminiferal bioturbation suggest that they are involved in sediment reworking and bio-irrigation making them single-celled ecosystem engineers.

												<b>Culturing Polycystine Radiolaria for Geochemistry</b><br>
												Polycystine radiolaria—the silicifying, strictly planktonic cousins of foraminifera—have not been used extensively for geochemistry, in spite of a fossil record dating back to the Cambrian and preservation requirements that complement calcifiers. One reason for this is their apparent reluctance to being grown in controlled laboratory conditions, a technique that has been used to ground truth foraminifera-based proxies. I will present insights from two three-month culturing seasons at Villefranche-sur-mer, France in which we maintained radiolarians (primarily Spongolivella, a spumellarian) under different pH regimes for the purpose of testing their potential as a taxonomic medium for the boron isotope-pH proxy. We also tested food preferences and observed interesting behaviours, including cannibalism. We found they are readily kept alive for multiple weeks, in contrast to previous assumptions, and exhibit comparatively limited sensitivity to pH.

												<b>Raising Tiny Titans: The Art and Science of Culturing Planktonic Foraminifera</b><br>
												Planktic foraminifera have been cultured in the laboratory for over 50 years. The effort to grow forams in the lab was driven by the need to calibrate the chemistry of their shells to growth conditions and use the lab-based relationships to reconstruct past growth conditions (e.g., ocean temperature and pH). Early experiments were also conducted to understand foram ecology (what they eat, their tolerance to temperature or pH, for example). Over the last few decades, the methods for growing forams in the lab setting have changed significantly and continue to be modified by many different lab groups globally. In this talk, I'll share how my lab group cultures planktic foraminifera and will discuss possibilities for future experiments to expand the utility of fossil specimens and understand future climate change impacts.

												<b><i>Phaeocystis</i>/Acantharia symbiosis: what are they exchanging?</b><br>
												Acantharian form a group of a ~150 species divided four main orders (Holacanthida, Chaunacanthida, Symphiacanthida and Arthracanthida), 18 families, about 50 genera and in 6 main clades and 13 subclades. Among these clades, some are specifically characterized by their ability to form endosymbiosis with microalgae, especially <i>Phaeocystis</i>. They are widely distributed in the Oceans and symbiotic clades are preferentially found in oligotrophic waters, where they represent a high percentage of carbon fixation. In marine ecosystems, photosymbiosis between heterotrophic hosts and microalgae is fueled by photosynthesis, which facilitates the transfer of organic carbon, such as sugars, to the host. However, the specific carbohydrates involved and the molecular mechanisms governing their exchange remain largely unknown, particularly in unicellular photosymbioses that dominate open-ocean environments. Through a combination of genomics, single-holobiont transcriptomics, and environmental metatranscriptomics, we explored the transportome of the marine microalga <i>Phaeocystis</i> in symbiosis with acantharians, focusing on sugar transporters. Genomic analyses revealed that the sugar transportome of <i>Phaeocystis</i> is similar to that of non-symbiotic haptophytes. However, symbiotic <i>Phaeocystis</i> exhibited substantial changes in transportome gene expression compared to its free-living stage, with 36% of sugar transporter genes showing differential expression. Additionally, these sugar transporter genes displayed distinct temporal expression patterns over the day. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underpinning the ecological success of planktonic photosymbioses and lay the groundwork for further studies on transporters in photosymbiotic systems.

												<b>Foraminifera: One of the last frontiers of protist symbioses</b><br>
												Symbiotic relationships between foraminifera and their prokaryotic and eukaryotic partners are incredibly diverse. However, these interactions have mostly been described through microscopy and remain largely unexplored using modern molecular methods. Consequently, foraminifera (together with other Rhizaria) represent one of the last protist symbiosis frontiers. In this talk, I will outline some of our projects on these symbioses involving taxonomically diverse foraminifera from distinct environments such as coral reefs, mangroves, and the deep sea. I will then focus on algal symbioses of large benthic foraminifera from coral reefs as our main model system. Photosymbioses of LBF with microalgae can easily rival coral-dinoflagellate endosymbioses in terms of their taxonomic diversity, but whether this diversity is also reflected in their functions and adaptations to marine microhabitats is unclear. We characterized symbioses of eight genera of LBF with diatoms, dinoflagellates, red algae, and green algae using single-cell metagenomics, phylogenetics, and microscopy. We show which of these symbiotic relationships are likely more long-term, that their chloroplast genomes are similar to their free-living relatives, and discuss the interdependence of the partners. Even though these novel symbiotic pairs enhance our broader understanding of eukaryote-eukaryote interactions, further functional characterization of the individual partners is needed to fully understand if and how the different microalgal symbionts drive the host adaptations to specific environments.

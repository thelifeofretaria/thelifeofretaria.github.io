												<b>Single-cell Transcriptomics Elucidates the Evolution of Retaria</b><br>
												Single-cell transcriptomics has allowed us to uncover the phylogenetic placement of an increasing number of hard-to-cultivate protist lineages, while also providing a scaffold for the reconstruction of the evolutionary history of their traits. Retarians (foraminifera and radiolarians) are mostly marine rhizarian amoebae which are infamously difficult to cultivate and represent one of the least studied groups of eukaryotes; consequently, little is known about their biology, ecology, and evolution. While previous phylogenetic and phylogenomic analyses have incorporated retarian lineages, there has been little consensus over the relationships between their major groups, and two conflicting topological hypotheses persist: (i) Acantharea as the sister group of Foraminifera &amp; Polycystinea; (ii) Foraminifera as the sister group of Acantharea &amp; Polycystinea. Moreover, the branching position of Sticholonchea remains unresolved. Previous attempts have been hindered by limited taxon sampling and poor data coverage, especially concerning radiolarians, and potentially by modelling artefacts. To address this and better represent retarian diversity, radiolarian and planktonic foraminiferan cells were individually collected from marine environmental samples; each cell was processed to obtain cDNA libraries, which were further used for high-throughput sequencing. Seventy-four new transcriptomes from as many retarian cells (17 foraminifera + 57 radiolarians) have been included in phylogenomic analyses along with publicly available data from an additional 41 taxa (28 foraminifera + 13 radiolarians), more than doubling the overall coverage. Preliminary results indicate that Foraminifera likely differentiated from a radiolarian ancestor, making radiolarians non-monophyletic with Acantharea as a sister group to all other retarians. However, the placement of Sticholonchea continues to be weakly supported. While additional analyses are required, the framework provided thus far already elucidates our understanding of the evolution of Retaria and can be used as a more reliable foundation for further studies.

												<b>Combining Transcriptomic, Microscopy and Phylogenomics to study Foraminifera</b><br>
												Foraminifera, single-celled protists with complex life cycles have long presented challenges for integrating molecular data. To address this, we developed a suite of methods to visualize and analyze the genome architecture and gene expression of Foraminifera. We adapted a workflow to isolate individual <i>Allogromia laticolaris</i> cells from the confocal and perform single-cell transcriptomics, enabling gene expression analysis directly from imaged cells. Furthermore, we present PhyloToL, a modular, user-friendly pipeline with taxon-rich databases that allow for effective data curation and phylogenomic analysis. With the increasing availability of ‘omics-scale data from diverse microeukaryotes, studies of eukaryotic evolution and symbiotic interactions, grapple with the difficulties inherent in integrating data of various types into taxon-rich studies. This is particularly challenging for analyses of uncultivable lineages for which single-cell approaches generate a mixture of sequence data from hosts, associated microbiomes, and contaminants. PhyloToL enhances phylogenomic reconstructions, facilitating the curation of transcriptomic data and the interpretation of evolution and diversity. Together, these methods establish a novel framework for providing key insights into Foraminifera biology and evolutionary history.

											<b>Acantharea Niche Partitioning: Insights from Novel Metabarcoding Visualization Methods</b><br>
											Acantharea are a monophyletic class within the rhizarian group ‘Radiolaria,’ consisting of around 150 species. They are distinguished by their celestite (SrSO4) skeletons, which provide both structural support and protection from predators and environmental stress. When they host photosynthetic endosymbionts, Acantharea can account for more than 20% of carbon fixation in nutrient-poor regions such as the Sargasso Sea, where this study was conducted. Due to their high abundance and activity, Acantharea are expected to play a critical role in broader nutrient dynamics, such as the transport of strontium and other trace elements. Despite their ecological importance, research on Acantharea has been limited, largely because their skeletons dissolve quickly after death. In this study, we introduce new methods for investigating Acantharea niche preferences, using six years of metabarcoding data collected from the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS) site. This data spans depths from the surface to 1000 meters. Our analysis reveals clear vertical stratification among 10 Acantharea orders, closely aligning with the transition between the epipelagic and mesopelagic zones. This suggests that different Acantharea groups have adapted to specific environmental conditions such as temperature gradients and resource availability at varying depths. These findings provide insight into the complex evolutionary and ecological processes that drive vertical niche partitioning and local adaptation within the Rhizaria community.<br><br>

												<b>Siliceous Rhizaria and ocean biogeochemistry: an overview</b><br>
												Siliceous Rhizaria are diverse both in morphology and ecology. Their size range spans a few tens of µm to several mm, and their skeleton made of biogenic silica makes them important contributors of the ocean silicon cycle. In particular, they constitute a unique source of biogenic silica production and stock in the mesopelagic layer, where no other silicifiers are found. They can be either heterotrophic or mixotrophic, and thus have different ecological niches and roles in the carbon cycles. Mixotrophic taxa, belonging to Radiolaria, are predominant in surface oceans and contribute to carbon uptake particularly in oligotrophic regions. Heterotrophic taxa, mostly belonging to Phaeodaria, are often found in the mesopelagic layer of productive areas, where they feed upon sinking particles. Upon death, these organisms sink, carrying organic and mineral material to the deep ocean. While Radiolaria are correlated to large flux events, Phaeodaria have the ability to aggregate particles around them, which are then ballasted by their silica skeleton. Yet, recently, it was estimated that large mesopelagic Phaeodaria could intercept up to 9% of the gravitational particle flux. This leaves an open question: are Rhizaria contributing to carbon fluxes or do they act as gatekeepers of the biological carbon pump?

												<b>The impact of foraminifera on the marine carbon cycle - using species distribution models to estimate global patterns and predictors</b><br>
												Planktic foraminifers are calcifying zooplankton that contribute to the biological carbon pump via the sinking of their calcareous shells. However, their importance for regional and global plankton biomass and carbon fluxes is not well understood. Here, we modeled global annual patterns of foraminifer total carbon (TC) biomass and total inorganic carbon (TIC) export fluxes over the top 200 m using five statistical species distribution models (SDMs). An extended version of the MARine Ecosystem DATa (MAREDAT) of zooplankton abundance observations was used to estimate the biomass.

										<b>Overview of the intriguing life of extant Retaria</b><br>
										The super-group Rhizaria is one of the most diverse and least described among the eukaryotic microbial world. Even though rhizarians have captured biologists’ attention for over a century, their tedious maintenance has hindered a proper comprehension of their life cycle. This is the case of Retaria, a lineage of marine planktonic and benthic shell-bearing amoebas, that have established a successful symbiosis with a diversity of microalgae during their evolution. The two major groups of Retaria, Radiolaria and Foraminifera, are both important actors in the global ocean's biogeochemical cycles by contributing significantly to the cycling and sedimentation of various elements, including carbon (C), silica (Si), calcium (Ca) and strontium (Sr). Previous studies have significantly advanced in the description of retarian distributions over space and time, as well as explored the extensive fossil record that these lineages provide for paleobiological research. However, our understanding of extant retarian biology is primarily derived from studies on cultured benthic Foraminifera and field observations of Radiolaria, with limited genetic resources available for both groups. Consequently, descriptions of retarian life cycles remain fragmentary and largely rely on knowledge acquired in the 80’s-90’s. This presentation provides a summary of key aspects of retarian life, with a focus on their life cycles, while also initiating a discussion on future research directions aimed at achieving a more comprehensive understanding of their biology and, thus, their ecology.<br>

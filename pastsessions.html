												<b>Siliceous Rhizaria and ocean biogeochemistry: an overview</b><br>
												Siliceous Rhizaria are diverse both in morphology and ecology. Their size range spans a few tens of µm to several mm, and their skeleton made of biogenic silica makes them important contributors of the ocean silicon cycle. In particular, they constitute a unique source of biogenic silica production and stock in the mesopelagic layer, where no other silicifiers are found. They can be either heterotrophic or mixotrophic, and thus have different ecological niches and roles in the carbon cycles. Mixotrophic taxa, belonging to Radiolaria, are predominant in surface oceans and contribute to carbon uptake particularly in oligotrophic regions. Heterotrophic taxa, mostly belonging to Phaeodaria, are often found in the mesopelagic layer of productive areas, where they feed upon sinking particles. Upon death, these organisms sink, carrying organic and mineral material to the deep ocean. While Radiolaria are correlated to large flux events, Phaeodaria have the ability to aggregate particles around them, which are then ballasted by their silica skeleton. Yet, recently, it was estimated that large mesopelagic Phaeodaria could intercept up to 9% of the gravitational particle flux. This leaves an open question: are Rhizaria contributing to carbon fluxes or do they act as gatekeepers of the biological carbon pump?

												<b>The impact of foraminifera on the marine carbon cycle - using species distribution models to estimate global patterns and predictors</b><br>
												Planktic foraminifers are calcifying zooplankton that contribute to the biological carbon pump via the sinking of their calcareous shells. However, their importance for regional and global plankton biomass and carbon fluxes is not well understood. Here, we modeled global annual patterns of foraminifer total carbon (TC) biomass and total inorganic carbon (TIC) export fluxes over the top 200 m using five statistical species distribution models (SDMs). An extended version of the MARine Ecosystem DATa (MAREDAT) of zooplankton abundance observations was used to estimate the biomass.

										<b>Overview of the intriguing life of extant Retaria</b><br>
										The super-group Rhizaria is one of the most diverse and least described among the eukaryotic microbial world. Even though rhizarians have captured biologists’ attention for over a century, their tedious maintenance has hindered a proper comprehension of their life cycle. This is the case of Retaria, a lineage of marine planktonic and benthic shell-bearing amoebas, that have established a successful symbiosis with a diversity of microalgae during their evolution. The two major groups of Retaria, Radiolaria and Foraminifera, are both important actors in the global ocean's biogeochemical cycles by contributing significantly to the cycling and sedimentation of various elements, including carbon (C), silica (Si), calcium (Ca) and strontium (Sr). Previous studies have significantly advanced in the description of retarian distributions over space and time, as well as explored the extensive fossil record that these lineages provide for paleobiological research. However, our understanding of extant retarian biology is primarily derived from studies on cultured benthic Foraminifera and field observations of Radiolaria, with limited genetic resources available for both groups. Consequently, descriptions of retarian life cycles remain fragmentary and largely rely on knowledge acquired in the 80’s-90’s. This presentation provides a summary of key aspects of retarian life, with a focus on their life cycles, while also initiating a discussion on future research directions aimed at achieving a more comprehensive understanding of their biology and, thus, their ecology.<br>

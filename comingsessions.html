												<b>Single-cell Transcriptomics Elucidates the Evolution of Retaria</b><br>
												Single-cell transcriptomics has allowed us to uncover the phylogenetic placement of an increasing number of hard-to-cultivate protist lineages, while also providing a scaffold for the reconstruction of the evolutionary history of their traits. Retarians (foraminifera and radiolarians) are mostly marine rhizarian amoebae which are infamously difficult to cultivate and represent one of the least studied groups of eukaryotes; consequently, little is known about their biology, ecology, and evolution. While previous phylogenetic and phylogenomic analyses have incorporated retarian lineages, there has been little consensus over the relationships between their major groups, and two conflicting topological hypotheses persist: (i) Acantharea as the sister group of Foraminifera &amp; Polycystinea; (ii) Foraminifera as the sister group of Acantharea &amp; Polycystinea. Moreover, the branching position of Sticholonchea remains unresolved. Previous attempts have been hindered by limited taxon sampling and poor data coverage, especially concerning radiolarians, and potentially by modelling artefacts. To address this and better represent retarian diversity, radiolarian and planktonic foraminiferan cells were individually collected from marine environmental samples; each cell was processed to obtain cDNA libraries, which were further used for high-throughput sequencing. Seventy-four new transcriptomes from as many retarian cells (17 foraminifera + 57 radiolarians) have been included in phylogenomic analyses along with publicly available data from an additional 41 taxa (28 foraminifera + 13 radiolarians), more than doubling the overall coverage. Preliminary results indicate that Foraminifera likely differentiated from a radiolarian ancestor, making radiolarians non-monophyletic with Acantharea as a sister group to all other retarians. However, the placement of Sticholonchea continues to be weakly supported. While additional analyses are required, the framework provided thus far already elucidates our understanding of the evolution of Retaria and can be used as a more reliable foundation for further studies.

												<b>Combining Transcriptomic, Microscopy and Phylogenomics to study Foraminifera</b><br>
												Foraminifera, single-celled protists with complex life cycles have long presented challenges for integrating molecular data. To address this, we developed a suite of methods to visualize and analyze the genome architecture and gene expression of Foraminifera. We adapted a workflow to isolate individualn <i>Allogromia laticolaris</i> cells from the confocal and perform single-cell transcriptomics, enabling gene expression analysis directly from imaged cells. Furthermore, we present PhyloToL, a modular, user-friendly pipeline with taxon-rich databases that allow for effective data curation and phylogenomic analysis. With the increasing availability of â€˜omics-scale data from diverse microeukaryotes, studies of eukaryotic evolution and symbiotic interactions, grapple with the difficulties inherent in integrating data of various types into taxon-rich studies. This is particularly challenging for analyses of uncultivable lineages for which single-cell approaches generate a mixture of sequence data from hosts, associated microbiomes, and contaminants. PhyloToL enhances phylogenomic reconstructions, facilitating the curation of transcriptomic data and the interpretation of evolution and diversity. Together, these methods establish a novel framework for providing key insights into Foraminifera biology and evolutionary history.
